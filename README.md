## Technology Used
- MinIO is an object storage service similar to Amazon S3. It is used to store and manage large data efficiently.
- PostgreSQL is a powerful open source relational database management system. It is used to store and manage structured data.
- Superset is an open source BI (Business Intelligence) platform for data visualization and exploration.
- Spark is a powerful big data processing engine, used to process and analyze data at large scale.
- Built all on Docker
- Google Cloud Platform: Google Storage, Compute Instance, BigQuery, Looker Studio

## Result
### Data is ETL and fully stored in PostgreSQL, Minio, Google BigQuery
